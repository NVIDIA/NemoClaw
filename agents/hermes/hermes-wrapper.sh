# Wrapper installed at /usr/local/bin/hermes that enforces the runtime
# environment secret boundary for `hermes gateway` (NVIDIA/NemoClaw#4975).
#
# The same guard runs in the nemoclaw-start entrypoint
# (agents/hermes/start.sh: validate_hermes_runtime_env_secret_boundary) and in
# the host-side gateway recovery path, but a direct `docker exec ... hermes
# gateway run` invokes the CLI without ever crossing the entrypoint, so it
# started the gateway with raw secret-shaped env vars (e.g.
# SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-real-...). Wrapping the binary closes that bypass: every
# path that launches the gateway now passes through the same single-source-of-
# truth validator before the port is bound.
#
# Only the `gateway` subcommand is guarded; all other hermes subcommands
# (dashboard, --version, ...) pass straight through unchanged.
#
# SECURITY: the validator and the real binary are resolved from fixed installed
# paths, never from the environment. This wrapper exists to reject a malicious
# runtime environment, so it must not let that same environment redirect the
# guard (to a no-op) or the binary it protects. The dev fallback resolves
# against this script's own directory so a checkout works without an install,
# matching start.sh's _HERMES_BOUNDARY_VALIDATOR resolution.
