## Description: <br>
Used for finetuning the NV-Generate-CTMR MAISI VAE from CT/MRI NIfTI datalists. Not for clinical or production data approval. <br>

This skill is for research and development only. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and medical AI researchers finetuning a variational autoencoder (VAE) for CT/MRI synthetic volume generation using NVIDIA's NV-Generate-CTMR MAISI framework. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`claude-code`) <br>
- Codex (`codex`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 2 evaluation tasks with 2 attempts per task (pass threshold 50%). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 4 | 100% (+50%) | 100% (+0%) |
| Correctness | 4 | 91% (-3%) | 86% (+34%) |
| Discoverability | 4 | 89% (+8%) | 78% (+23%) |
| Effectiveness | 4 | 60% (-31%) | 50% (+24%) |
| Efficiency | 4 | 67% (+9%) | 63% (+22%) |
