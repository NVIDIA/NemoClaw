# Domain helpers

Domain modules contain pure policy and decision logic. They should not import oclif, spawn processes, read host state directly, or call Docker/OpenShell.

Preferred layout:

```text
src/lib/domain/<area>/<topic>.ts
src/lib/domain/<area>/<topic>.test.ts
```

Flat files are acceptable for small cross-cutting helpers, but workflow-specific logic should live under an area directory that matches the command/action stack when practical:

```text
src/commands/internal/<area>/<verb>.ts
src/lib/actions/<area>/<verb>.ts
src/lib/domain/<area>/<topic>.ts
```

Configuration export represents retained startup intent. Managed OpenClaw exports
`agents[].tools.disclosure: direct` only when the registry selection agrees with
the validated startup profile. Absent or explicit `progressive` selection keeps
the canonical omission. Model compatibility can still downgrade runtime tool
behavior. Preserve managed-image authority and full residual profile equality;
admitting disclosure must not admit extra tool gateways or minimal-bootstrap settings.
